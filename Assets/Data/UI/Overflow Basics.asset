  UIPanelTitle: Magical Overflow
  UIPanelLabel: Tutorials
  UIPanelBody: "Practitioners of the arcane should take care not to overindulge in
    the use of their powers, lest they suffer an overflow of magical energy. Those
    who experience an overflow suffer great physical harm, and have their magical
    abilities weakened. If the edge of ones vision begins to blur, they should take
    care.\r\n\r\nWhile these effects will fade after a short time, it is oft advisable
    to avoid them if possible. \r"
